# A Family Feud inspired game with a twist!
* You will start by selecting a question from the drop down on the homepage
* Once you've selected a question decide who is on team1 and who is on team 2.
* Once you've decided on the teams, have team1 and team 2 each submit an answer.
* After that, the team with the highest voted answer starts!
* Once the starting team has been selected, that team has three chances to guess
  as many correct answers as they can. If that team hits three incorrect answers, it is
  the other team's turn.
* Every question has 6 answers, when all 6 correct answers have been guessed, the team with
  the highest remaining points wins that round!
